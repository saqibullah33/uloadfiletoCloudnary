# Project Documentation: Node.js API Endpoint for Uploading Files to Cloudinary

## Introduction
This documentation outlines the usage and implementation details of a Node.js API endpoint for uploading files to Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service. The API endpoint allows users to upload images, videos, or any file type to Cloudinary, reducing their size using Cloudinary's optimization features. After successful upload, the endpoint returns the URL of the uploaded file, which can be shared with users.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system
- Cloudinary account credentials (cloud name, API key, API secret)
- Basic understanding of RESTful APIs

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
## Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Cloudinary credentials:
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret


## Usage

### Uploading Files
- **Endpoint**: `localhost:8080/api/v1/file-upload-cloudnary`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**:
  - `file`: The file to upload
- **Response**:
  - `status`: Status of the request (`success` or `error`)
  - `message`: Additional information regarding the request
  - `url`: URL of the uploaded file on Cloudinary
 

## Cloudinary Optimization

This project utilizes Cloudinary's capabilities to optimize uploaded files. By default, Cloudinary optimizes files for storage by reducing their size without significantly affecting quality. You can further customize optimization parameters in the Cloudinary dashboard.

## Implementation Details

- The project is built using Node.js and Express framework.
- Multer middleware is used for handling file uploads.
- Cloudinary SDK is utilized for interacting with Cloudinary services.
- Environment variables are managed using the dotenv package.
- Error handling and response formatting are implemented to provide clear feedback to users.

# Project Documentation: Node.js API Endpoint for Uploading Files to Cloudinary

## Introduction
This documentation outlines the usage and implementation details of a Node.js API endpoint for uploading files to Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service. The API endpoint allows users to upload images, videos, or any file type to Cloudinary, reducing their size using Cloudinary's optimization features. After successful upload, the endpoint returns the URL of the uploaded file, which can be shared with users.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system
- Cloudinary account credentials (cloud name, API key, API secret)
- Basic understanding of RESTful APIs

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
